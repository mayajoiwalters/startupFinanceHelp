  <h1>Startup Owner's Personal Budget</h1>
<p>Usually they won't make too much profit in the first few months of operations. Because of that, we'dll need to take into account their personal budget and calculate how much will be needed to survive at least the first six months of business.</p>
<p>This is very similar to a business budget and can be completed in three steps:</p>
<b>
<ol>
<li>Track expenses</li>
<li>Categorize and describe purchases</li>
<li>Budget by the month</li>
</ol>
</b>
